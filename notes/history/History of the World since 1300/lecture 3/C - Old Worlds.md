# Old Worlds

## Christendom involved 2 fronted-conflicts:
* Russia: exploration North and East
* West (re)pushing Muslims into Africa

## 2 kingdoms (sealed by nuptial pact):
* Isabelle of Castille
* Ferdinand of Aragon

## Explorations into Africa (later half of 15th)
* discovery of islands in the middle Atlantic (Canaries, Azores) which became a social experiment for Europeans
* creation of the very first colonies
* 1st sugar plantations in history
* 1st form of African slavery (attached to the plantation)
* going West toward the African Coast meant tapping into sources of gold
* discovery of equatorial currents and winds to use in sailing (ships could sail West in order to reach the East)

## Christopher Columbus
* made constants navigational mistakes in his logs
* arrived in the Caribbean's islands
* on behalf of Isabella and Ferdinand (in the process of reconquering Spain from Muslim powers)
* Columbus took natives with him on the boat to teach them Spanish and learn the native language
* to his death, he never thought he discovered 'new worlds'

## Colony
* production of tropical commodities to Europe
* Europeans carried the learning they had learned in the Atlantic islands and applied them in Hispaniola and beyond, to create the production of wealth for somebody else
* Indian workers began to die because of disease
* need for external labor
