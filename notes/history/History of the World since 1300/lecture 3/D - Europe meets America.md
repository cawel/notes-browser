# Europe meets America

## Hernan Cortez
* arrived with 500 men, 16 horses
* 1519: reached the coast of Mexico
* met with Aztec rivals
* forged alliance with some of the rival powers

## Expedition to Tenochtitlan (capital of Aztec Empire)
* 1521: fall of Tenochtitlan
* 1521: fall of Constantinople (capital of Byzantine Empire)
* the Aztec sacrificed Montezuma, who was ready to cut a deal with the Spanish
* Cortez took an army of 100 000, only 600 were Spanish, to bring down the Aztec power

## The real killer
* the real enemy was invisible
* what brought down the Aztec Empire in the end was disease
* when Cortez crosses the city, within 2 years of the contact, 40% of the population was dead
* same for Incas (its leader would succumb to smallpox)

## Tenochtitlan
* magnificent city
* for Europeans, the closest to Tenochtitlan was Naples with 200 000 people

## Global perspective
* 1520s: Portugese deployed a diplomatic expedition to Beijing
* Europeans are moving East and West

* conquistador Pizarro deliver fatal blow to the Inca Empire

## Conquest process
* Spaniards felt they had to keep as much of the incumbent structure in place
* get rid of the ruling class, keep much of the political pyramid that held together these great empires
* a process of amalgamating indigenous structures to Spanish patterns of rulership

## Not always after precious metals
* North America: wealth was found in form of fur taken from beaver pelts
* woodlands of North America and jungles of the Amazon, it was much less a militarized process, but more negotiated between the newcomers and the incumbents

## What to remember
* multiple ways in which Europeans engaged with Indians as they began the
process of conquest and colonization
