# The Columbian Exchange

Historian Alfred Crosby coined "the Columbian exchange"

## what did the Americas get?
1. biota (microbes)
2. flora, crops: cotton, rice, indigo, bananas, sugar
3. fauna (horses, cattle, sheep, pigs)

## Americas' population dramatically dropped
* within the 1st century after European contact, pop dropped from 100-120 million to 20 million
* they tried to blood in Europeans' bread
* they put infected bodies into the wells

## Diseases
* 14 separate epidemics that would spread across the new world
* worst diseases were the eruptive fevers: smallpox, measles, typhus

## Pigs
* pigs had no predators
* they would destroy many of those islands, eating the grasses and plants
* wonderful source of sustenance for Europeans populating America 

## Origin of the word "barbecue"
* pirates would live off roasted pigs on islands
* they ate those pigs from tail to head (from "barbe" to the "queue")

## What Americans gave back
1. biota (syphilis)
2. their own flora: tomatoes, maze, cocoa, potato
3. precious metals (gold and silver)

## Other interesting facts
* most European armies, by the end of 16th century, were inflicted with syphilis
* the potato was fantastic because it yielded greater calories per hectare than Eurasians' staples

## Ecological windfall
* Europeans found in the Americas access to cheap source of food, ready access to precious metals which would transform the balance of world power between the East of Eurasia and West of Eurasia
* it would give Europeans resources to redefine their relationships with the rest of the world
