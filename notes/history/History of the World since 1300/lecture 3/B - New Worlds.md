# New Worlds

## internal and external tension sources
* external threats: rivalries
* internal threats: imperor successions

## Geography
* Aztec Empire was occupying South of today's Mexico
* Aztec Empire's capital: Tenochtitlan
* today the ruins of Tenochtitlan are located in the central part of Mexico City
* Inca Empire was occupying West of South America
* administrative, political and military centre of the Inca empire was located in Cusco in modern-day Peru

## Aztecs
* external threats were more pronounced because of neighbours
* form of warfare between the 2 neighbours
* more cohesive empire because of a strong priestly and warrior class
* 1502: Montezuma II chosen to be the heir of the Aztec Emperor

## Aztec sacrifices
* ripping the bleeding heart of a captive and holing it up to the sun to ensure the sun would keep burning
* 1487: 20k to 80k humans were sacrificed in a single prolonged ritual
* search for new captives means the Aztec Empire had to continue to subordinate peoples

## Incas
* Incas did not practice human sacrifices
* deep feuding among successors
* seething civil war within the heart of the Incan empire

## Image of passive peoples is wrong
* they could fight
* they were very wealthy. Indeed, wealth was the lure for many conquistadors

## Internal tensions afflicting the Inca and the Aztec empires when the Spaniards arrived in the New World:
* feuding amongst imperial successors
* conflict among warrior and priestly classes
