# The Black Death

## roads were conveyers for:
* priests
* merchants
* conquering armies and cavalries
* but also invisible things, e.g. pathogens

## The Great Plague
* 14th century
* as series of plagues across Eurasia
* followed the ways of the Silky Road
* migratory paths of pathogens were the same as the Silk Road
* pathogens were carried by the ships and caravans 
* infected the hubs
* carried by rats on boats

## Devastating for populations
* China pop = 120 million by 1320s to 80 million within a generation
* Europe lost 60% of its population

## most effective regions for spreading
* trading ports
* posts
* caravan cities

## Black Death
* fragmentation of Mongol Empire
* kingdoms from the empire (which Genghis Khan donated to this sons) drifted apart and collapsed 
* terrible blow to commercial and political interconnections
* Black Death = a metaphor to think about the interconnectedness
* 13th century = period of growing interconnection
* 14th century = period of turmoil, death
* destruction was a clean slate for a whole new political system, heralding a new phase in world history

## worlds apart
* not all parts of the world was equally affected
* no contact = no borrowing
* The Americas was completely unaffected
* Americas = a world apart
* parts of inland Africa was unaffected

## North Africa and East Africa
* North Africa and East Africa were affected by Afro-Eurasian processes
* they were integrated within the Silk Road and the sea lane systems
* Mogadishu was an important port in the Sea Land trading system
* The Swahili Coast (the root of "Swahili" in Arabic means Sahel = Southern Coast of the Sahara)

## People mingling
* the centre piece of these trading hubs was the mosque
* mixed communities create cosmopolitan communities
* integration of coastal regions into the broader trading network
* including beginning shipment of slaves out of Africa for sale
* 1150: we have evidence that African slaves working for Arabs in the port of Canton
* ppl amalgamated inherited traditions with new practices that they encounter by sharing communities with other people

## what to remember
* not just commodities that were exchanged
* the interconnectedness also had unintended consequences (e.g. plague)
