# The Wealth of Villages

## What is world history?
* modern definition is synonymous of evolution of globalization through trade
* can include:
    * organization of intl institutions
    * proliferation of NGOs

## Criticism
* globalization was not linear
* Adam Smith portrays commercialization as the engine of globalization
* but there were many breaks, resistances
* history of globalization:
    * is complex
    * has multiple origins
* men like Adam Smith are often Europe-centric

## History
* non-agrarian populations started to grow
* early process of integration
* early trade between the countryside and towns

## Luxury goods
* exchange of one particular kind of good: luxury goods
* produced in the countryside for urban consumption (not for subsistence needs):
    * cloth in Northern Europe
    * weapons in South Asia
    * silks in China
    * plant products (spices, safran in Spain, cinnamon in Sri Lanka, pepper in India)
* light, easy to move around, high value to their bulk. Good to be shipped far away 

## Summary of early globalization
* production of goods (not for subsistence needs)
* production of goods shippable increasingly far away

## China
* increasing number of villagers dedicated to produce these kinds of goods
* harnessing the power of water (hydraulic technology)
* construction of the grand canal in China, connecting South (rice fields) with the North (urban districts in Beijing)
* fusing the farming sectors (in the South) with the bureaucratic and military sectors (in the North)
* between 8th and 12th century, population doubled, reaching 100 millions
* deforestation of Southern China, as the agrarian frontier moves ever southwards, destruction of habitats that sustained macro-fauna, like elephants (implicit war between farmers and elephants)

## Agrarian expansion important to global history
1 cycle between the creating of wealth and possibility of constructing and centralizing power 
    * which created resources that states could harness)
    * negotiation between those who are able to skim the surpluses of agrarian societies (e.g. merchants and tax collectors)
2 trade between countryside and cities grew connections, and created an interdependence
