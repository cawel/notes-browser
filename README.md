# Notes Browser

## Intro

When doing online courses, I write a lot of markdown-formatted files. I wanted to read them in a browser so I hacked this notes-browser utility. 

A live version of this utility is live at: http://notes-browser.herokuapp.com/


## How to use it

1. Put your notes files in a 'notes/' directory in the project directory. 
2. Start Rails server
3. Browser your notes through the web
