# Notes Browser

## Introduction

When taking online courses, I take notes in files using the Markdown syntax. I wanted to read them in a HTML browser – benefitting from CSS styles – so I created this simple tool to browse and display my note files. 

The latest version of this app (so that you get the idea) is live at: http://notes-browser.herokuapp.com/


## How to use it

1. Dump your notes files in a "notes/" directory in the root directory of this project. 
2. Install with:
``` 
bundle install
``` 
3. Start Rails server with:
``` 
rails server
``` 
4. Browse your notes through the web at http://localhost:3000
