# Buddhism

## Intro

* Buddhism is a religion based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, who lived about 25 centuries ago in what is now Nepal and northeastern India.
* The most common estimate of the number of Buddhists in the world today is 350 million, which makes Buddhism the fourth largest of the world's religions.


## The Buddha

* The history of Buddhism is the story of one man’s spiritual journey to Enlightenment, and of the teachings and ways of living that developed from it. 
* Siddhartha Gautama = The Buddha
* By finding the path to Enlightenment, Siddhartha was led from the pain of suffering and rebirth towards the path of Enlightenment and became known as the Buddha or ‘awakened one’.


## The life of Siddhartha Gautama

* Siddhartha Gautama was born around the year 580 BCE in the village of Lumbini in Nepal. 
* A life of luxury. He was born into a royal family, and his privileged life insulated him from the sufferings of life; sufferings such as sickness, age and death.
* Discovering cruel reality. One day, after growing up, marrying and having a child, Siddhartha went outside the royal enclosure where he lived. When he went outside he saw, each for the first time, an old man, a sick man, and a corpse. This greatly disturbed him, and he learned that sickness, age, and death were the inevitable fate of human beings – a fate no-one could avoid.
* Becoming a holy man. Siddhartha had also seen a monk, and he decided this was a sign that he should leave his protected royal life and live as a homeless holy man. 
* Siddhartha’s travels showed him much more of the suffering of the world. He searched for a way to escape the inevitability of death, old age and pain first by studying with religious men. This didn’t provide him with an answer.


## The foundation of Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths:

* The truth of suffering (dukkha)
* The truth of the cause of suffering (samudaya)
* The truth of the end of suffering (nirhodha)
* The truth of the path that frees us from suffering (magga)
